===================

## Objectives

- [ ] Understand why we request data asynchronously
- [ ] Create `fetch` requests (including `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- [ ] Manipulate the DOM in conjunction with `fetch` calls
- [ ] Understand optimistic vs pessimistic rendering

### Deliverables (User Stories)

Expand the functionality of the JS Pokemon Search Assignment!

- [ ] As a user, I should see all the Pokemon
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to delete a Pokemon on click of a button
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to create my own Pokemon
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to edit a clicked Pokemon

These changes should _persist_ in our database.
